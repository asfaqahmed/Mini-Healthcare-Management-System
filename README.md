Project Name: Mini Healthcare Management System (simplified HMIS)

(Optional) Deploy to AWS EC2 or Docker Hub.

Practice Focus:

Docker basics

Environment variables

AWS deployment knowledge

ðŸ”¹ Part 4 â€“ last 

Add unit tests (Pytest for backend, Jest for frontend).

Write a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions (test + build + dockerize).
